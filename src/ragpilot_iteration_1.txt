RAGPilot – Intelligent Document QA Platform for Enterprise Knowledge
Brief description
RAGPilot is a cost-efficient, production-ready system that transforms unstructured documents—such as PDFs, emails, reports, and SharePoint files—into a searchable knowledge base powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It enables employees to ask natural language questions and receive accurate, source-linked answers through a secure, streaming chatbot interface. Built with a FastAPI backend and a Next.js admin panel, RAGPilot offers advanced hybrid retrieval, graph integration, customizable pipelines, and full observability for enterprise-scale deployment.
